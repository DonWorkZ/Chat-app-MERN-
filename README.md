#####
Initialize your app with a package.json using an npm command
Create a start command in your package.json with the contents “node app.js”, or a dev command in your package.json with the contents “nodemon app.js”
Enter the following contents into a file and start your server with “npm start” or “npm run dev”. HINT: You might need to do something before your app is able to run.
Uncomment the line that begins with // app.use(express.someMiddleware()) and replace some Middleware with a built-in middleware function from express that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser
Increment the numRequests variable inside of numRequestsMiddleware before next() is called.
GET “/” should respond with “You visited the API numRequests times” instead of “Coding interview 3!” (make sure an integer is displayed for the count)
GET “/cars” should respond with the array of cars
POST “/cars” should add a car to the cars array with an id and respond with a 201 status code

these are the steps 1 through 8
